#This is my web-based application that am building with MERN stack
so far I have implemented only the dashboard analytics feature;
I have lifted the feature state that is the revenue data which will be needed by some components later to Revenue context and I have my Dashboards.tsx to provide the context so that it can be consumed.
am still using mock data though I have managed the stated so that when i simulate a real api call it will be much easier and I can say this project deepens my understanding of single source of truth and the rule of the thumb
